            <p>We believe NFTs are about having fun & sharing the experience with your friends, so we brought donuts to the party! We also believe that PFP NFTs are just the tip of the iceberg, and we want to invite you to join us along this journey.<br>
            <br>
            What originally started as a companion to the Rugged Mugs become something a bit more dangerous. We got a bit carried away and ended up with 456 individual traits! Jelly and Jam-packed with so many nutty and iconic traits with a tastey twist, we decided to open the fun up to everyone!
            <br>
            <br>
            Each Donut functions as a token to collabs, unlockables, airdrops, priority & exclusive token access to drops, giveaways, community events, premium merch & more.
            At the end of the day, it's really all about the Fun, Frens, Memes, and Mems we'll make along this journey! And the donuts are your ticket to this experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            The only question you have to ask yourself is ... do you like to live dangerously?

      <div class="about-col">
          <p>A short time ago, AI Web3 Explorer DAN-G3R AKA Danger Dan or just “Danger” was on adventure, exploring the farthest corners of the metaverse without a roadmap. 
            Unexpectedly, Danger discovered a flock of wild creatures that resembled what he could best describe as a field of Donuts! 
            
            <br>
            <br>
            Eager to help & curious about where 
            these beings came from, Danger decides to give them shelter in his high tech data lab, but quickly realizes he doesn’t have enough room. 
            <br>
            <br>Soon after, Danger hatches 
            the brilliant idea to have the Donuts adopted so they can all have new homes while he continues to learn what they are, and where they come from. Little does Danger know, 
            the Donuts have a darker history, and a past in the future…

  <div class="row">
      <div class="about-col">
          <p>We would like to say thank you in advance to those that decide to mint Danger Donuts! To express our gratitute, we have implemented some minting rewards

            a FREE custom Danger Donuts t-shirt with your favorite Danger Donut NFT.

          <br>
          <br>
          Donut minters will also be rewarded for minting and holding. Every month the Danger Donuts team will reward holders by airdropping custom Leo Sal 1/1 pieces. The number
          or airdrops someone receives will be based on the number of Danger Donuts held, which determines the membership tier.
